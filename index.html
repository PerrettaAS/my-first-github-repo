                <p class="content-block-content">Hello, and welcome to my portfolio website! I've developed this website using the languages, HTML, CSS, and Javascript in sublime text. To help develop some of the content, the libraries I've used are Hover.css, Cycle2, and jQuery. I will be adding more content to the website as I work on more personal projects.</p>

                <h1 class="content-block-header">About</h1>
                <p class="content-block-content">I am an aspiring software engineer with great interests in the field of artificial intelligence. I am a second-year Computer Science major at Central Connecticut State University with a minor in Management Information Systems. I've always had a passion for programming and creating a product from conception to production.</p>
                <p class="content-block-content">I began programming when I was around 14, developing simple command-line applications. Throughout high school, I worked with the Arduino microprocessor using C and C++, or on small game projects in Java. The games I would create were usually emulations of pre-existing games like snake or flappybird. After high school, I had a strong interest in AI research and I'd watch documentaries and read papers on various topics in this field. I plan on taking an AI course next year at CCSU and hope to expand my knowledge in this field.</p>
                <p class="content-block-content">I currently work as a software engineering apprentice in the A100 program. The A100 program is an apprenticeship program for aspiring software developers. The program mentors work with college students and graduates eager to hone their skills in the craft of software development. Throughout this program, we work on three individual projects, and one venture project. Over the course of the venture project, you work in two sprints to take a startup companies' product idea, and develop a fully functional product. As the scrum master of this project, I've gained a lot of experience with working in a development team and facilitating the communication with the team members and the product owner.</p>

                <h1 class="content-block-header">A* Search Algorithm Research Project</h1>
                <p class="content-block-content">While taking Data Structures at Central Connecticut State University, I was given an assignment to research a graphing algorithm of my choice. The task was to research, implement, and present the algorithm we chose. After some research, the A* search algorithm caught my eye, and I decided to complete my project using this algorithm.</p>
                <p class="content-block-content">The A* search algorithm is a graphing algorithm that determines an efficient traversal path from one node to another. It combines elements of Dijkstra's algorithm and greedy best-first-search to efficiently determine the shortest path. For my implementation, I created a 2D tile-map game where a character can walk on any grassy terrain, while prohibited to walk on any rocky terrain. The implementation of the algorithm allowed the player to click on any grassy tile, and take the shortest path to get there. I chose this type of implementation because this algorithm is popular with different tile-map based games.</p>

                <h1 class="content-block-header">NoteShare</h1>
                <p class="content-block-content">NoteShare is my second individual project I developed in the A100 program. This application is a tool where you can create notes and post them online and share them to everyone on the site. You will also have the ability to create private notes for yourself and groups of people that you'd like to share specific notes with. For now, the notes are all publicized, however, this is a work in progress and I will continue to work on this project over time.</p>
                <p class="content-block-content">There are several features I plan on implementing into this project. One feature I'd like to have is group notes. Each account can create different groups of friends, and they can then share notes within this group. This will allow private notes that you can share with anyone you want to. Another feature I'd like to have his public notes within an area. Essentially, there would be a section of notes that were created and publicized near the user's location. These are some of the future features you'll see in this project as I continue to work on it.</p>
