To help develop some of the content, the libraries I've used are Hover.css, Cycle2, and jQuery. I will be adding more content to the website as I work on more personal projects.</p>

                <h1 class="content-block-header">About</h1>
                <p class="content-block-content">I am an aspiring software engineer with great interests in the field of artificial intelligence. I am a second-year Computer Science major at Central Connecticut State University with a minor in Management Information Systems. I've always had a passion for programming and creating a product from conception to production.</p>
                <p class="content-block-content">I began programming when I was around 14, creating simple command-line programs. Throughout high school, I worked with the Arduino microprocessor using C and C++, or on small game projects in Java. The games I would create were usually emulations of pre-existing games like snake or flappybird. After high school, I had a strong interest in AI research and I'd watch documentaries and read papers on various topics in this field. I plan on taking an AI course next year at CCSU and hope to expand my knowledge in this field.</p>
                <p class="content-block-content">I currently work as a software engineering apprentice in the A100 program. The A100 program is an apprenticeship program for aspiring software developers. The program mentors work with college students and graduates eager to hone their skills in the craft of software development. Throughout this program, we work on three individual projects, and one venture project. Over the course of the venture project, you work in two sprints to take a startup companies' product idea, and develop a fully functional product. As the scrum master of this project, I've gained a lot of experience with working in a development team and facilitating the communication with the team members and the product owner.</p>
